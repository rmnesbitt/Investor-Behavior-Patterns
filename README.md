**Uncovering Monetizable Trends from Synthetic Financial Activity Data**

---

## Project Overview

This project explores simulated investor behavior to identify monetization opportunities, regional investment patterns, and user segments with strategic growth potential. By analyzing synthetic transactional and product usage data, I developed actionable insights that can inform business strategy, customer segmentation, and product positioning.

## Purpose

To analyze patterns in investor behavior across risk preferences, regions, product types, and account activity in order to:

- Understand fee generation by investor type and product
- Identify high-value segments for upselling or personalization
- Uncover trends in multi-account usage and regional investment
- Explore whether account age correlates with portfolio value

- Python: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and prototyping

**Techniques:**
- Segment-Based Behavioral Analysis  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Key Insights

| Insight | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk & Fees** | Aggressive investors pay **13% more per transaction** than Conservative ones—implying higher monetization potential per trade. |
| **Regional Trends** | The **Western U.S.** leads all regions in **total investment** across product categories. |
| **Product Monetization** | **Robo-Advisors** produce the **highest fee revenue per dollar invested**, outperforming traditional channels. |
| **Multi-Account Users** | While most users have 1–2 accounts, those with **4+ accounts** represent the most **valuable upsell targets**. |
| **Account Tenure** | Surprisingly, **account age does not predict portfolio size**—challenging common assumptions in retention models. |

- **Target high-account users** for cross-sell campaigns  
- **Focus on regional strengths** (e.g., West Coast dominance)  
- **Rethink loyalty programs** not tied to account tenure
